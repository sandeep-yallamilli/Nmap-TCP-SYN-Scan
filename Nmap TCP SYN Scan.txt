Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.90 seconds


1. Scan Summary
Scan Command Used: nmap -sS 192.168.1.31

Nmap Version: 7.95

Scan Date: May 26, 2025

Scan Time: 09:32 IST

Scan Type: TCP SYN Scan (-sS)

Target IP Address: 192.168.1.31

Host Status: Up (Latency: 0.020s)

MAC Address: E2:F8:B6:86:91:09 (Vendor: Unknown)

Scan Duration: 0.90 seconds

Total Ports Scanned: 1000

Closed Ports: 1000 (reset)

Open Ports Detected: 0

2. Observations
All scanned TCP ports are closed on the target system (192.168.1.31).

The system responded to the probe, indicating that it is live, but no services were detected as accessible during the scan.

The TCP reset responses indicate active rejection rather than a silent drop, suggesting a device or firewall is explicitly closing connections.

3. Recommendations
‚úÖ From a security standpoint:

This host exhibits a secure posture for the scanned TCP ports. No open services were exposed during the SYN scan.

üîç For further inspection:

Consider scanning with additional flags (e.g., -sU for UDP, -p- for all ports, or -A for aggressive detection) to uncover hidden services or determine the operating system.

Ensure the device is intended to have all ports closed; if services should be running, check firewall or network configuration.

4. Conclusion
The system at 192.168.1.31 is reachable on the network, but all scanned TCP ports are closed. No actionable vulnerabilities were observed from this scan, which suggests minimal exposure. However, further scanning or physical inspection may be required depending on the intended function of this host.
